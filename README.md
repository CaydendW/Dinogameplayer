# Dinogameplayer
A short python script that plays the google chrome dinosaur game.

Warning: This script takes screen capture and uses it to play the game. It is specificaly tuned to play it at [this](https://wayou.github.io/t-rex-runner/) website, on a 1920x1200 monitor, on microsoft edge, on a windows pc. If you try it on any other setup it will fail miserably. You can adjust where the frame looks.

# Dependencies
